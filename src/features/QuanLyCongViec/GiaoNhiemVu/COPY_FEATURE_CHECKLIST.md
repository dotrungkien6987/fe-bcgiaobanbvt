- [ ] Diff calculation correct (added/removed/unchanged)
- [ ] Soft delete for removed assignments
- [ ] Restore logic for existing assignments
- [ ] Statistics returned correctly

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

1. ✅ Code committed to repository
2. ✅ Documentation completed
3. [ ] Code review by team
4. [ ] Manual testing completed
5. [ ] Backend API verified
6. [ ] Deploy to staging

## 🔄 Future Enhancements

1. **Partial Copy**: Select specific duties instead of all
2. **Multi-target**: Copy to multiple employees at once
3. **Templates**: Save assignment templates for quick apply
4. **History**: Track copy operations for audit
5. **Undo**: Allow reverting copy action
6. **Batch Copy**: Copy from one to many in one action
7. **Smart Suggestions**: AI suggests optimal assignment copies
8. **Copy Preview**: Show detailed diff before confirm
9. **Schedule Copy**: Schedule copy for future date/time
10. **Export/Import**: Export assignments as file, import to others

## 📝 Notes for Developers

### Architecture Decisions

1. **Reuse Batch Update API**: Instead of creating new endpoint, reuse existing `PUT /nhan-vien/:id/assignments`
2. **Two-step Copy**: Fetch source assignments → batch update target
3. **Frontend Filtering**: Filter eligible employees in frontend for better UX
4. **Soft Delete**: Don't actually delete assignments, just mark as deleted

### Code Patterns

- Follow project convention: Redux manual thunks (no createAsyncThunk)
- Use Material-UI v5 components
- Vietnamese UI text throughout
- Toast notifications for all actions
- Comprehensive error handling

### Performance Considerations

- Only 2 API calls per copy operation
- Minimize payload: send only duty IDs
- Auto-refresh only affected employees
- Dialog search filters client-side

### Security

- Backend validates KhoaID match
- Authentication required (loginRequired middleware)
- Authorization: Only manager can copy for their employees
- Soft delete preserves audit trail
